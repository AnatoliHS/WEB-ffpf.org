#  23nd Annual Freedom from Poverty Foundation Fundraising Dinner

12 November 2020

The Board of Directors of the Freedom From Poverty Foundation have decided to
defer this year’s annual fundraising dinner because of the ongoing Covid-19
pandemic.

In its place we will be holding an online fundraising campaign that starts
this November 2020.

Please follow all of the Health authorities guidelines to keep yourselves and
your families safe and we will see you all at the annual fundraiser in 2021.
