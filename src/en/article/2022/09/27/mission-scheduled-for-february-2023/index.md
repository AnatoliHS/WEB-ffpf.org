#  Suyagya Vasishta Arya Mission 2023 – FFPF Mission February 2023

27 September 2022

After the spread of the Covid-19 disease, which started in early 2021, three
surgical missions had to be cancelled. The funds that had been earmarked for
these missions were used to provide the village of Jamkhed with materials for
the prevention and treatment of Covid-19: oxygen, intravenous drugs, masks,
and facilities for quarantine. The houses in the rural villages are very small
and have only one room, so isolation is impossible.

Thanks to the funds the Freedom from Poverty Foundation raised during the
November 2022 fundraising dinner, 3 humanitarian surgery missions have been
carried out. Indeed, our surgical camps resumed this year after a 2-year break
following the Covid. In February, 11 professionals from the greater Montreal
area went to Jamkhed, India.

All our camps are held at Julia’s Hospital in Jamkhed, Maharashtra. Several
hundred people have undergone surgery. The surgeries we do (perform or
execute) help change the future of these people.

For example, they can walk or regain the use of a hand lost in an accident.

In addition, our pharmacists have worked with village pharmacists to improve
the management of high-risk medicines to create algorithms and carts for using
medicines in emergencies.

We performed mostly orthopedic surgeries with the aim of restoring a person’s
functionality to break the cycle of poverty.

Here are the members who participated in the February 2023 mission:

In February 2022, The Freedom from Poverty Foundation sent our mission to the
village of Jamkhed. We sent sixteen professionals from Montreal.
