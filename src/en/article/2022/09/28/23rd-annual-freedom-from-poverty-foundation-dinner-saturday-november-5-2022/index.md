#  23rd Annual Freedom from Poverty Foundation Dinner – Saturday, November 5,
2022

28 September 2022

The 23rd Annual Freedom from Poverty Foundation Fundraising Dinner is
happening:

Saturday, November 5, 2022, at  
Le Chateaubriand, 7985 Blvd Maurice-Duplessis, Montreal,QC H1E 1M5

We invite you to come and join us for a charming, culture-filled evening that
includes; music, dancing, an open bar and delicious, tantalizing Indian
cuisine. Funds raised at this dinner will go towards our upcoming missions and
our ongoing work to provide access to education and healthcare for those in
need. Everyone on our medical team volunteers their time for free and pays for
their travel  
costs.

Tickets are $125/person, with a tax receipt to be issued for the donation
portion.  
Tables of ten are also available for groups.

The Freedom from Poverty Foundation, Inc. was established in Montreal in 1993.
The on-going mission of the FFPF is to improve the quality of life for the
very impoverished people in India. By providing them with increased access to
education and healthcare – we are helping the less fortunate break out of the
cycle of poverty and therefore have a better chance at a real, productive and
optimistic future.
