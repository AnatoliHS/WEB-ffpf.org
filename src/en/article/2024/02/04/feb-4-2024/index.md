Our Canadian team of health professionals arrived around dinner time and were
warmly welcomed by the children of CRHP nursery school. A ceremony, a little
dance, several smiles and laughter were there. The team enjoyed a delicious
meal cooked by local women. They then headed to Julia Hospital and began
triaging patients requiring surgical and dental care. The camp was able to
benefit from the required equipment thanks to the precious generosity of our
donors, the Dwividi-Sareen family (surgical camp) and Subhash Khanna (dental
camp). None of this would have been possible without the collective work of
the Canadian and Indian teams as well as our donors.
