Today is the 4th day of the FFPF camp at the CRHP Jamkhed, already halfway
through the camp and many patients have received the care required for a
better quality of life. The Canadien team of healthcare professionals are
continually adapting to their new environment, each one is extremely satisfied
and blessed to be making a significant difference in the lives of the
patients. Around lunch time, the communication team had the chance to meet a
young patient who had received surgeries and follows-ups for more than 4
years. A hand malformation at birth is now almost a thing of the past. With a
smile on her face and sparkling eyes, this young child gives us hope and
inspiration every day.

Later in the evening, it was possible to take the time to chat and get to know
Doctor Bruno Mastropasqua, plastic surgeon and medical director of the
mission. Here is the summary of our discussions:

Q1 What is your greatest pride at CRHP?

The day I go to paradise and someone asks me «show me five things you’ve done
and I can let you in», I will be able to say that these are the things that I
did here at the CHRP. The patients on whom I had the chance to operate and
when I say «I», I include all the members of the team, because we change the
flow of women’s lives. In Montreal, if it’s not me who operates, there will be
another surgeon, whereas here… there is no one else to do it.

Q2 What mark would you like to leave at the CRHP?

As I say to my son, «First, do no harm» then after that if you can make a
difference in the lives of people in a positive way, that’s a bonus… the
cherry on top of a sundae.

Q3 What is your favorite song to listen to when operating on patients?

These days, I actually like Charlotte Cardin or even Billie Elish. I think it
starts the day the right way.
