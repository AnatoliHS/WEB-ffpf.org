This is the website being changed quickly. This last day of surgical and
dental camp was filled with kindness, love and hope. All patients who received
surgical care were seen in the morning by the medical team to ensure
uncompromised post-operation and recovery. A few surgeons got involved and
even inflated a few surgical gloves to create personalized balloons for each
child. This little magical thought helped to alleviate the anticipation and/or
fear when removing the dressings and above all to create happy patients.

In total, there were nearly 600 dental cases and more than fifty surgical
cases which were treated by health specialists. This year was a success like
the previous years. The generous help of everyone made it possible to create a
new beginning for the patients who presented themselves and made it possible
to create bonds that will be difficult to forget. We would like to thank the
precious help of our donors, the Dwivedi-Sareen family (surgical camp) and
Subhash Kanna (dental camp), without forgetting the collective work of the
Canadian and Indian teams who have worked with passion and dedication the last
six days.

Finally, in order to thank each individual who contributed to the success of
this mission, it was possible to witness a magnificent farewell ceremony at
the very end. The Canadian medical team of professionals was moved by this
celebration and had the opportunity to get a taste of the cultural richness of
this country.

Thank you dear reader for taking the time to read us.

See you next year.
