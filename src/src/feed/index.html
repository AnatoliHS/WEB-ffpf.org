<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This last day of surgical and dental camp was filled with kindness, love and hope. All patients who received surgical care were seen in the morning by the medical team to ensure uncompromised post-operation and recovery. A few surgeons got involved and even inflated a few surgical gloves to create personalized balloons for each child. This little magical thought helped to alleviate the anticipation and/or fear when removing the dressings and above all to create happy patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, there were nearly 600 dental cases and more than fifty surgical cases which were treated by health specialists. This year was a success like the previous years. The generous help of everyone made it possible to create a new beginning for the patients who presented themselves and made it possible to create bonds that will be difficult to forget. We would like to thank the precious help of our donors, the Dwivedi-Sareen family (surgical camp) and Subhash Kanna (dental camp), without forgetting the collective work of the Canadian and Indian teams who have worked with passion and dedication the last six days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in order to thank each individual who contributed to the success of this mission, it was possible to witness a magnificent farewell ceremony at the very end. The Canadian medical team of professionals was moved by this celebration and had the opportunity to get a taste of the cultural richness of this country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you dear reader for taking the time to read us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See you next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The routine settles in more easily and the familiarization with the place allows them to be proactive as soon as they enter Julia hospital. The efficiency of the Canadian medical team has made it possible to reduce the list of patients waiting for surgery. The team continues the transfer of knowledge and skills to the Jamkhed health care team, with the main goal of ensuring continuity and follow-up with post-operation patients. The dental camp is also going well and the staff keeps doing prevention and education with the young and adult patients. Let’s say that all the patients leave with clean teeths and a radiant smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little before lunch time, it was possible to take the time to chat and get to know Doctor Nathalie Brisebois, an occupational therapist for over 35 years now. Here is the summary of our discussions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q1 What factor influences your decision to return year after year to the CRHP camp?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people who work here, the looks of the patients that we have had the chance to operate on and especially the patients we have treated in the past who come back to us with a beautiful smile. They seem happy to see us again and they also seem to understand that we made a difference in their lives… There is nothing more rewarding than thinking that we had the chance to help several people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q2 How would you describe your experience at CRHP?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an experience that is extremely enriching but also destabilizing, because arriving in an environment that is totally different from home, it sometimes happens that we feel lost&#8230; but we also manage to find ourselves with people with whom we share this mission. It&#8217;s incredible to think that we have a language barrier that doesn&#8217;t allow us to communicate easily with patients, and yet we manage to work miracles with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 What do you appreciate the most about Indian culture?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The generosity and kindness of people. At first, patients sometimes look at us with a little suspicion, but we quickly realize that we are strangers. After surgeries, these same patients often ask us to take photos with them because they want to come to us and it’s their way of thanking us. India is all about smiles, sharing and kindness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is the 4th day of the FFPF camp at the CRHP Jamkhed, already halfway through the camp and many patients have received the care required for a better quality of life. The Canadien team of healthcare professionals are continually adapting to their new environment, each one is extremely satisfied and blessed to be making a significant difference in the lives of the patients. Around lunch time, the communication team had the chance to meet a young patient who had received surgeries and follows-ups for more than 4 years. A hand malformation at birth is now almost a thing of the past. With a smile on her face and sparkling eyes, this young child gives us hope and inspiration every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the evening, it was possible to take the time to chat and get to know Doctor Bruno Mastropasqua, plastic surgeon and medical director of the mission. Here is the summary of our discussions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q1 What is your greatest pride at CRHP?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day I go to paradise and someone asks me «show me five things you’ve done and I can let you in», I will be able to say that these are the things that I did here at the CHRP. The patients on whom I had the chance to operate and when I say «I», I include all the members of the team, because we change the flow of women’s lives. In Montreal, if it’s not me who operates, there will be another surgeon, whereas here… there is no one else to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q2 What mark would you like to leave at the CRHP?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I say to my son, «First, do no harm» then after that if you can make a difference in the lives of people in a positive way, that’s a bonus… the cherry on top of a sundae. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 What is your favorite song to listen to when operating on patients?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, I actually like Charlotte Cardin or even Billie Elish. I think it starts the day the right way.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New day also means new challenges to face. The start of the day is the same as the one that preceded it and the morning walk allows you to start the day on the right foot. The Canadian team of health professionals came together for a post-mortem of their first day, allowing them to put in place new solutions for a proactive progress of this second day. At 9:00 am, all members of the team, including health professionals as well as the communication team, were at their respective posts ready to practice their profession with passion and dedication. Familiar faces resurface from one year to the next and new surgical procedures will improve their daily lives. Even with a busy day, the communications team takes the time to welcome, listen and understand the stories of many patients who have been victims of unfortunate incidents that have left them with physical and psychological scarring. The whole team is satisfied with how their day went and meets after the sunset for a wonderful dinner.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As dawn broke, our team, eager to greet the day with vitality, set out on the quaint trails leading towards Jamkhed. The early morning walk, a harmonious blend of gentle exercise and camaraderie, allowed them to stretch their limbs and immerse themselves in the tranquility of nature. The highlight was witnessing the magnificent sunrise, a serene moment that perfectly set the tone for the bustling day ahead. Following their rejuvenating walk, the team gathered in the garden, where a delicious breakfast awaited. Over comforting cups of chai, they shared in the joy of planning the day&#8217;s endeavors, each sip and bite fueling their enthusiasm for the tasks that lay ahead.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the surgical camp, over ten patients have undergone transformative procedures, promising to vastly improve their daily lives. Meanwhile, in the dental camp, close to a hundred individuals received thorough assessments and treatments, leaving not only with brighter smiles but also with dental kits in hand. United in purpose, every member of both camps diligently worked together, embodying the core values of FFPF and CRHP: to provide equitable care, transcending boundaries of gender, age, faith, and social status, ensuring that every patient is treated with the same respect and dignity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the day drew to a close and the sun dipped below the horizon, our Canadian team of health professionals gathered in the serene garden to unwind. In this tranquil setting, they exchanged stories of the day&#8217;s triumphs and lessons learned, each tale punctuated by shared laughter and reflective moments. Clutching cups of their preferred drinks, they recharged their spirits, readying themselves for the new faces and stories that awaited them with the dawn.</span></p>

<p>As you are aware that Freedom from Poverty Inc. has been in existence since 1993 and will be organizing its 2th annual gala dinner on Saturday November 11,2023 at Le Chateaubriand. We request you to please reserve that date and would love to see you at our fundraising dinner.</p>
