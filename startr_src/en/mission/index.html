                                        Over the past year, we have medically assessed hundreds of people, from which we have selected 150. Last November, we held our benefit dinner, which sponsored all the patients.

<p>
                                        After the spread of the Covid-19 disease, which started in early 2021, three surgical missions had to be cancelled. The funds that had been earmarked for these missions were used to provide the village of Jamkhed with materials for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19: oxygen, intravenous drugs, masks, and facilities for quarantine. The houses in the rural villages are very small and have only one room, so isolation is impossible.
                                     </p>
<p>
                                        Thanks to the funds the Freedom from Poverty Foundation raised during the November 2022 fundraising dinner, 3 humanitarian surgery missions have been carried out. Indeed, our surgical camps resumed this year after a 2-year break following the Covid. In February, 11 professionals from the greater Montreal area went to Jamkhed, India.
                                     </p>
<p>
                                        All our camps are held at Julia’s Hospital in Jamkhed, Maharashtra. Several hundred people have undergone surgery. The surgeries we do (perform or execute) help change the future of these people.
                                     </p>
<p>
                                        For example, they can walk or regain the use of a hand lost in an accident.
                                     </p>
<p>
                                        In addition, our pharmacists have worked with village pharmacists to improve the management of high-risk medicines to create algorithms and carts for using medicines in emergencies.
                                     </p>
<p>
                                        We performed mostly orthopedic surgeries with the aim of restoring a person’s functionality to break the cycle of poverty.
                                     </p>

                                        In February 2022, The Freedom from Poverty Foundation sent our mission to the village of Jamkhed. We sent sixteen professionals from Montreal.

Our team focused on orthopedic surgeries, restoring persons’ functionality and breaking the cycle of poverty.

<p>
                             The Freedom from Poverty Foundation donated specialized medical equipment to the Julia Hospital in Jamkhed for procedures specific to the needs of the population. For example, a Dermatome was donated so that skin grafts can be performed on people who have suffered from large burns. The sterilization room was also updated thanks to donations of equipment from the Foundation.

<p>
                             The community of Jamkhed demonstrated their immense gratitude to the Freedom from Poverty Foundation. Many of the patients who received operations in 2016 were waiting for us at the Julia Hospital to express their thanks for the major change we have made in their lives.

<p>
                             The Freedom from Poverty Foundation performed its first surgical mission. A team of specialists from Montreal provided care to 77 patients, performing mainly orthopedic operations and scar contracture release with skin grafts. The operations were performed on people with one or more handicaps, from birth or the result of an accident, that have kept them dependent or unable to work. A team of medical students provided the postoperative care. They worked by video conference with an occupational therapist in Montreal, Ms. Brisebois.
